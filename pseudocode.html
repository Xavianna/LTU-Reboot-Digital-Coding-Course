    print to the screen numbers 1 to 10

    document.write - print to the screen

    for loop
    1-10

    FOR LOOP:
        START NUMBER 1, CONDITION, START NUMBER + 1

        DOCUMENT.WRITE ( NUMBER )

for 1, as long as 1 < length.

for loop, starting number is 1, condition: as long as starting number is less than 10.

for (start number, condition, increment){
    document write number
}

start number needs to be a variable, and the value of 1

for (var start Number = 1;)


depending on what temperature, tell the user what clothes to wear.

What is the temperature?
    The temperature will change, so the keyword LET would be a good choice.
    let temperature;

How are we going to show the output?
    alert [x]
    document.write
    console.log [x]
    create a new element, using the DOM

What clothes?
